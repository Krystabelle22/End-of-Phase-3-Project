# End-of-Phase-3-Project
## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model that determines whether an order will be on time or delayed based on key factors such as delivery distance, order time, and customer ratings. The model will provide insights and recommendations to improve delivery efficiency and reduce delays.
This section includes a more in-depth explanation of the methodology and analysis used.

## Business and Data Understanding
### Stakeholder Audience
The primary stakeholders for this project include:

- Logistics Managers – To optimize delivery scheduling and improve efficiency.
- E-commerce Platforms – To enhance customer experience by reducing late deliveries.
- Data Scientists & Analysts – To refine predictive models and enhance business intelligence.

### Dataset Choice
The dataset used in this project contains historical order records, including delivery times, order details, and customer feedback. Key features include:

Order Timestamp – When the order was placed.
Delivery Time – Actual time taken to deliver.
Distance – Between the warehouse and customer location.
Customer Ratings – Feedback on service quality.

## Modeling Approach
To develop a predictive model that classifies orders as on-time or delayed, we follow these key steps:
1. Import Necessary Libraries
Load essential Python libraries for:

- Data analysis (pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Machine learning (scikit-learn)

2. Load and Inspect Dataset
Check dataset structure, missing values, and feature distributions.

4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations: Analyze delivery time distributions, feature correlations, and outliers.
Feature relationships: Explore dependencies between distance, time of day, and order delays.

6. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

8. Feature Engineering
Create new features like delivery speed and order volume.
Convert timestamps into meaningful insights (e.g., peak vs. off-peak hours).

10. Train-Test Data Splitting
Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

12. Build a Baseline Model
Train an initial logistic regression model as a benchmark.

14. Evaluate the Baseline Model
Use metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- 
15. Model Iteration & Optimization
Experiment with decision trees, random forests, and boosting algorithms.
Tune hyperparameters for improved performance.

16. Model Selection & Feature Importance
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Analyze which features influence delivery delays the most.
Evaluation & Performance Metrics
Compare different models based on:
- ROC-AUC Score
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Confusion Matrix
- Interpret results in the business context to recommend improvements.
  
## Conclusion & Business Impact
Key Takeaways: Insights into common delay patterns and optimization strategies.
Actionable Recommendations:
- Improve warehouse processing times.
- Optimize delivery routes based on distance and traffic conditions.
- Use real-time order tracking to notify customers.

## Next Steps
1) Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
2) Automate model retraining to adapt to new order trends.
3) Integrate with business intelligence tools for better decision-making.
