Steps to Build the Predictive Model
In this notebook, the following steps shall be followed to develop a model that helps the business predict whether an order will be on time or delayed:

Import Necessary Libraries: Import Python libraries required for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
Load and Inspect the Dataset: To understand its structure, features, and data types.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of key variables (e.g., delivery times, distance, ratings).
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable: Identify trends, patterns, and potential outliers.
Handle Missing Data and Data Cleaning: Identify and address missing or inconsistent data.
Remove or impute missing values as necessary: Handle outliers or anomalies that may skew the analysis.
Feature Engineering: Create new features (e.g., delivery speed, time of day) to enhance model performance.
Transform existing features (e.g., encode categorical variables, scale numerical features).
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets: To evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Build a Baseline Model: Train a simple, interpretable model (e.g., logistic regression) as a baseline for comparison.
Evaluate the Baseline Model: Assess the baseline model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and interpret the results in the context of the business problem.
Iterate and Improve the Model: Experiment with more advanced models (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Compare the performance of different models.
Select and Finalize the Best Model: Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Analyze feature importance to understand which factors most influence delivery delays.
Communicate Results and Recommendations
Summarize the findings and insights from the model.
Provide actionable recommendations for the business to optimize delivery times and reduce delays.
Save the Final Model.
Export the final model for deployment using tools like joblib or pickle.
